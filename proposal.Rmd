### Title: 

#### Predictors of 2020 US Elections - Twitter or The Polls?


### Motivation for this project


US polls have been the center of attention in recent presidential elections due to the fact that the results have not accurately reflected predictions ([US PresidentialElection Polls Failure](https://news.northeastern.edu/2020/11/04/the-polls-were-still-way-off-in-the-2020-election-even-after-accounting-for-2016s-errors/)). 
Pollsters suggest that the evidence of the 2016 and 2020 elections will improve polling models. 

On the other hand, the evolution of social media has been tied to political behavior such as voting ([Twitter as Indicator for Political Behavior](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079449)). Since the public is quickly losing the trust of polls for political elections, researchers are now exploring whether social media activity can be utilized to assess offline political behavior. We believe that extracting online social networking environments can shed light on communication patterns and political preferences of individuals.

We hypothesize that social media (within the US and potentially outside of the US) can be beneficial in identifying elelectoral behaviors. We want to use Twitter (specifically geocoding tweets referencing presidential candidates) to identify the political affiliation to that region.

### Intended final product

*  A final report
*  A webpage containing descriptive statistics, visualizations related to polls distribution and trends, interactive map comparing twitter hashtag frequency of 2020 US presidential candidates by county/state and US polls 
*  Interpretation of comparisons between twitter posts and polls in regards to elections

### Anticipated data sources: 

[US Election Twitter ](https://www.kaggle.com/manchunhui/us-election-2020-tweets)

[2020 Election Forecast](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/election-forecasts-2020)

[2020 Election](https://www.kaggle.com/unanimad/us-election-2020)

[UN - World Happines Report, potentially useful](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness?select=2019.csv)

### The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

In this project, we will:

* Compare tweets of #Biden/#Trump by county/state and US polls to see if tweets are more accurate of predicting presidential results. We will make a choropleth map to visualize states that tweeted #Biden and #Trump and compare it to the 2020 election outcome. We will do the same with the polls. 

* Explore possible correlations between Twitter election-related post and their features (e.g. tweet share, emoji) and election results.

#### Plot/Charts:  

1) Distribution of #Biden/#Trump tweets by state;  
2) US polls prediction of winning candidate by state   
3) Graph of Current Votes by state for US Election Results  
4) Interactive visualisization of tweets features and content and their distribution by state

##### Challenges

1) Cleaning up tweets free-text or identifying meaningful variables in free text
2) Processing the poll data to allow polls/tweets comparison
2) Identifying proper model for correlation 
3) Building an interactive visualization embedded into a web site
4) Handling large volume of data
